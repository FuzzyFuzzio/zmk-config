CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT=y
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL=y
# Enable BLE split functionality so central features compile
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=y
# Optional: set a supported TX power value; commented out to avoid choice warning.
# See Zephyr BT controller Kconfig for available values. Examples:
# CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_0=y
# CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_PLUS_4=y
# CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_PWR_PLUS_8 is deprecated on some controller revisions.
# Number of split BLE peripherals expected (left + right halves)
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_PERIPHERALS=2
# Ensure USB HID is enabled
CONFIG_USB_DEVICE_STACK=y
CONFIG_ZMK_USB=y
# (ZMK exposes HID automatically when CONFIG_ZMK_USB is set)
# Optional: keep awake less aggressively
CONFIG_ZMK_SLEEP=y
CONFIG_ZMK_IDLE_TIMEOUT=300000
# Enable virtual input resurrection from peripherals
CONFIG_INPUT=y
# Central-only BLE enhancements (now satisfied by CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE=y)
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_FETCHING=y
CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE_CENTRAL_BATTERY_LEVEL_PROXY=y
# Removed experimental connection param until needed; it depends on broader ZMK_BLE features.
# CONFIG_ZMK_BLE_EXPERIMENTAL_CONN is unset to silence dependency warning.
